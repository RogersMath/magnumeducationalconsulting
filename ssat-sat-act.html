            <p>The SAT focuses more on reasoning and problem-solving, with sections for Reading, Writing and Language, and Math. The ACT assesses curriculum-based knowledge, covering English, Math, Reading, and Science, with an optional Writing section. Many colleges accept either, so choosing the right test often depends on a student's strengths and preferred question styles.</p>
