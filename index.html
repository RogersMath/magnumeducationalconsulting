                <p>Laura Atkinson, M.Ed., M.Sc.
Founder & Educational Consultant
In 2012, Laura Atkinson began her career teaching secondary mathematics and has since advanced through roles as Special Education Coordinator, Academic Dean, Secondary School Principal, and University Instructor. In 2023, she founded Magnum Educational Consulting to bring a holistic, student-centered approach to academic success.
Laura holds a Bachelor of Science degree from Nova Southeastern University and two Master’s degrees, one in Exercise Science and another in Special Education, from Florida Atlantic University. She also holds professional teaching certifications in Exceptional Student Education, Mathematics, Social Studies, and Biology, as well as endorsements in Reading and Autism Spectrum Disorders.
Laura’s extensive experience across both traditional and non-traditional educational settings, including traditional public schools, elite private schools, admission-selective charter schools, and one-on-one tutoring, makes her an exceptional choice to guide your student toward academic success. Additionally, her background as both a former SAT and ACT Testing and SSD Coordinator equips her with valuable insights into standardized testing and the accommodations process.
Her commitment to the development and implementation of academic experiences is driven by a deep-rooted passion for motivating not only her most ambitious students, but also her most unenthusiastic ones. Beyond academics, Laura is dedicated to helping students build executive functioning skills, improve their interpersonal communication, and become their own advocates. Her personalized approach includes student-centered tutoring, college counseling, and curriculum development to meet each student’s unique needs.
With her versatile background and dedication to individualized learning, Laura empowers students with the tools, confidence, and mindset they need to excel both in and out of the classroom.
